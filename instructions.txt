1. When we run the social_distance_detector.py file it processes the video with the help of yolo-weights, which were generated by training on coco-dataset. And then saves the output with the name of outut.avi.
2. A real-time detection will also take place in a pop-up window.
3. The script takes various arguments which can be understood by runing the script with --help or -h flag.
4. For testing purpose you can simply use the following command bu first you have to download the yolo-weights file from the below drive link and save it in the yolo-coco directory 

COMMAND: - python detector.py --input pedestrians.mp4 --output output.avi --display 1
